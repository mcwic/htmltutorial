# Getting Started Writing Webpages

Making webpages is really quite simple! To get started you only need two tools:

1. A Web Browser
2. A Text Editor

We recommend the following browsers:

- [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie)
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)
- [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Google Chrome](www.google.com/chrome/)

These are some of our favorite text editors:

- Notepad (Pre-Installed on Windows)
- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows Only)
- TextEdit (Pre-Installed on Mac)
- [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) (Mac Only)
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
